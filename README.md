# Predict Employee Attrition

This project helps predict whether an employee will leave a company or not using machine learning. We used the **IBM HR Analytics Dataset**, which contains 1,470 employee records with features like age, job role, income, overtime, satisfaction, etc.

## üß† Goal
- Predict employee attrition (leave/stay)
- Understand key reasons behind employee turnover
- Help HR take steps to retain employees

## üìä Dataset
- From: IBM (available on Kaggle)
- Rows: 1,470 employees
- Features: Job role, income, age, distance from home, satisfaction, etc.
- Target: `Attrition` (Yes or No)

## üîÅ ML Pipeline

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked attrition by job role, income, satisfaction, overtime, etc.
   - Found patterns (e.g., more attrition among people who work overtime)

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Encoded categories
   - Split data into training/testing sets
   - Balanced classes

3. **Models Used**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
   - Gradient Boosting

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve

5. **Explainability**
   - **SHAP**: Showed most important features influencing decisions
   - **LIME**: Explained individual predictions

## ‚úÖ Key Findings

- **Top reasons employees leave**:
  - Frequent overtime
  - Low job satisfaction
  - Long distance from home
  - Low salary

## üí° HR Suggestions

- Reduce overtime
- Improve job satisfaction
- Provide flexible work options
- Review salary structure
